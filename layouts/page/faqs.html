                        Yes, you may cancel as long as you cancel 24 hours prior to the scheduled time of the stream you are cancelling. But please remember, if you've purchased a ticket for the stream, it entitles you to watch the VOD (Video on Demand) of that stream, so even
                        if you can't watch the stream live, you can still see the session you purchased, in its entirety, as a VOD. All VODs are unedited recordings of the live stream.

                        Firefox and Safari seem to be the best browsers for this type of live streaming broadcast. Internet Explorer and Google Chrome have produced mixed results. Another element that can affect the quality of your stream is the version of the browser you’re

                        Credits or refunds will be issued if it is determined there is a malfunction sending out the stream. StreamingForTheSoul.com or CLE is NOT responsible for user end issues, i.e., the failure of your local server, personal computer problems, logging on
                        at the wrong time, etc. If there is a malfunction sending out the stream from our end we will notify everyone via the chat box. This has never happened in 12 years of Live Streaming. If this were to occur we would reimburse the
                        unused portion of the ticket or offer credits or free streams to make up for the lost stream. Please consider all tickets as you would for any live event, for example a concert, seminar, or theatrical event – they typically don't
                        refund you if you purchase the ticket and then don't show up. And follow the suggestions above testing your connection first. We recommend logging well in advance of the event to make sure the tickets you purchased are assigned
                        to your account and that you have an updated browser and version of Flash, and you have sufficient Internet speed to view the stream.
