about_event: "The “Solar Sneeze” as termed within the SSP has spawned many different theories and belief systems. No one knows with certainty just what will occur during a CME (Mass Coronal Ejection), “Kill Shot” or EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse). Scientific predictions include everything from 3 days of Darkness, to a Mass Extinction Event, Rapid DNA Upgrades and the Transition of Densities; while also many spiritual and religious texts have predicted the Rapture, “Golden Age” or Kali Yuga, Harvest, Spiritual Ascension and the Apocalypse. With the heightened Geo Political climate coupled with the intensification of natural disasters and earth changes, Gaia (Earth) is going through the transitional birthing pains of Ascension along with everything and everyone upon it. Corey will recount in detail what has been shown to him during his contact experiences with the Blue Avians (5th Density ET’s) regarding the Solar Sneeze and Ascension. He will also talk about the preparations the Anshar (4th Density Human Beings) are taking now in anticipation of the coming solar event and what role humanity plays in preserving their timeline."
