about_event: "The Alliance is closing in on their final goal of defeating the Cabal and sending many key conspirators off to prison. However, even the Alliance has felt we are “not ready” for a full disclosure. Instead, they are pushing for a “Partial Disclosure,” where we still learn some very amazing things but the full truth could be withheld for 20, 50, even 100 years. However, we already have a very good idea of what that suppressed “full truth” will be! Join David Wilcock in this tour-de-force presentation, where we come face-to-face with the intel he has gathered from multiple insiders working within the Secret Space Program, including his 10-year associate Emery Smith, who very recently came forward. Emery claims to have autopsied some three thousand different types of extraterrestrial humanlike species, and his information has electrified the UFO community with new revelations."
